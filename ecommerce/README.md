# Major Update

> Since discovering django-cookie-cutter, I have decided to move the project I have built 
> thus far into a separate folder.
> I will start the implementation of this project again from the ground up. This shouldn't 
> be an issue since most of the integration from the previous version is already implemented 
> here using the django-allauth third party app.
> This will gradually devolve from having both local and production environments to just production.
